# ConservationVision Watershed Impact Model
The purpose of the Virginia ConservationVision Watershed Impact Model is to help establish geographic priorities for conservation, restoration, or implementation of best management practices, where the goal is to maintain or improve water quality and/or aquatic ecological integrity. It is intended as a geospatial screening tool for assessing where activities on the land are expected to have the greatest impact on water.
